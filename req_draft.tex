\title{Visualizing commit comments with chromograms}
\begin{document}
\maketitle
\section{Must-Haves:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The product's front end is a website working with recent and well known browsers (e.g. Firefox, Google Chrome, latest release of Firefox, Opera, Safari, mobile Versions of them). The top bar contains links to the main site, a documentation or help site and one to the site, where the repositories are visualized. The main site contains a short explanation what the sites purpose is and shows some example pictures. The rendering site uses AJAX to display a progress bar while the backend renders the pictures. With AJAX again it displays them when rendering is finished.
\item It supports visualization of the commit comments of git repositories from a given URL.
\item The visualization is displayed in an overall timeline in separated pictures.
\item The visualization parameters will be the commit message and the kind of change of the repositry files. Kind of change means if there was an addition to a file, a delete or a real change of a line.
\item The product is released open source and usable with the version of apache which is supported at release time.

\section{May-Haves:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The product supports visualizing mercurial and subversion repositories for commit message and kind of change as explained above.
